# Test Data

Test data is created from publicly available long read data sourced at the ENA.

We have chosen some samples from the [Human Pangenome Data Explorer](https://data.humanpangenome.org/raw-sequencing-data)
and the associated project on ENA [PRJNA731524](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA731524). Hoping to increase
the number of shared variants, we have chosen samples from a single arbitrarily chosen population - Toscani in Italia
which are listed in the file `samples.txt`.
